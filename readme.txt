Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 3.3.1
Stable tag: 3.3.1

Automatically generates menu from taxonomies, custom post types, categories, pages, posts and custom links.

== Description ==
With WP-Easy Menu you can describe your menu using categories, pages or custom links.
The main difference between this plugin and the built-in menu generate is that if you add a new category or page, it will automatically appear on menu. So it will grow as soon as you add content to your blog.
